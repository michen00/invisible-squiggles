# Invisible Squiggles Extension

The **Invisible Squiggles** extension for Visual Studio Code lets you toggle the visibility of editor squiggles (errors, warnings, and informational messages). In addition, it leverages AI-powered suggestions to help you fix TypeScript errors using Hugging Face's **CodeT5** model.

## Features

### Toggle Squiggles
- **Hide** or **restore** error, warning, and info squiggles (underlines) in your editor with a simple command.
- Squiggles are made transparent instead of being completely hidden, making it easier to focus on code while still having visual cues.

### AI-Powered Fix Suggestions
- **AI fixes** are suggested for TypeScript errors using **Salesforce's CodeT5 model** hosted on Hugging Face.
- Once a TypeScript error is detected, the extension fetches an AI-powered suggestion to help fix the issue.
- Suggestions are shown as information messages in VSCode.

## Installation

1. **Install the Extension:**
   - Open VSCode.
   - Go to the **Extensions** view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar.
   - Search for "**Invisible Squiggles**" and click **Install**.

2. **Manual Installation:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.
   - Open the extension folder in VSCode.

## Usage

1. **Toggle Squiggles:**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette.

   - This will toggle the squiggles' visibility on/off (transparent or restored).

2. **AI Fix Suggestions:**
   - Errors in TypeScript files will trigger an automatic AI suggestion, which will be displayed as an information message.
   - The AI suggestion can help fix issues detected in your code by providing recommended changes.
